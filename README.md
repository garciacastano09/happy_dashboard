# HappyMap Dashboard

HappyMap Dashboard is a Polymer component that integrate other ones (called widgets) in order to offer a modular visualization of emotion-analyzed tweets.

If you want to deploy the demo (likely you do), it is required [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Al process is covered [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
